# Project 2 - Travel Briefing

## MVP

- **Build a web application using create-react-app**. Must be your own work.
- **Use React framework** to build your application with _at least_
  - 3 components
  - 4 props
  - 2 state properties
  - 2 setState
  - 2 routes
  - 3 different reach hooks
- **Use 3rd party API and/or Firestore**
  - API call with Axios and display the data for the user. You may use any API of your choosing or [Find an available API here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
  - You may also opt to use Firebase/Firestore if you need to store data.
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world. [README Template](https://github.com/SEI2-jeddah/README-Template/blob/master/README.md)

## Challenges

- integrating two APIs in order to provide an image for each country - as Travel Briefing API does not provide images for each country
- learning to use Material UI
- rendering the Cards components according to search options
- restructuring of the weather data from an object into an array to map them into a TimeLine component
