# Project 2 - Travel Briefing

### About

This website has a list of countries for you to choose from. It provides you with the following information on each country:

- Travel advice e.g. do not travel, reconsider your need to travel, etc
- Electricity e.g. voltage, frequency and types of plugs
- Telephone e.g. calling code, emergency hotlines
- Recommended vaccinations to get before visiting the country e.g. Hepatitis A, Malaria
- Weather, average temperature for each month

#### Challenges

- integrating two APIs in order to provide an image for each country - as Travel Briefing API does not provide images for each country
- learning to use Material UI
- rendering the Cards components according to search options
- restructuring of the weather data from an object into an array to map them into a TimeLine component
